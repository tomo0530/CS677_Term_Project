# CS677 Term Project

I have been given the monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural product (let's call it Syrup) in 10 different provinces of a country between January 2015 to December 2020. This Syrup comes from a fruit. It takes a few months for the fruits to grow on the trees which bear them. It also takes a few days to extract the Syrup from the fruits after they have been harvested.

I would like to predict the production quantity for Syrup from Jan 2020 to Dec 2020 with the data through 2019 using both machine learning and deep learning. Also, since it would be too complicated to cover all provinces, I use only region_id = 93 in this project.
